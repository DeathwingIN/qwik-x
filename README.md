## Configure Neon for Serverless PostgreSQL Database

Neon provides a serverless PostgreSQL that scales automatically and offers significant performance benefits. To integrate Neon with your Qwik-X app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Neon Account

- Sign up for a free tier account at [Neon](https://neon.tech/). Follow the prompts to set up your account.

### Step 2: Create Your Database

- Once logged in, create a new database. Choose the appropriate region closest to your user base to minimize latency.
- After creating your database, you will be provided with a database URL. This URL is used to connect your application to the Neon database.

### Step 3: Configure Your Application

- Open the `.env` file in your project‚Äôs root directory.
- Replace the existing database URL with the one provided by Neon in the `DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL` variable:
  ```
  DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL=postgres://{user}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{database}
  ```

### Step 4: Validate the Connection

- Ensure that your application can connect to the Neon database by running a simple test query or using the Drizzle ORM commands provided in your package scripts.

### Step 5: Schema Migration

- To create and sync the database schema:
  ```shell
  pnpm migration:push
  ```
- This command will align your PostgreSQL schema with the current state of your application models.

### Step 6: Start Your Development Server

- Once the database is configured and the schema is in place, start your development server:
  ```shell
  pnpm dev
  ```

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection issues, verify the database URL and your internet connection.
- Ensure that your Neon account's security settings allow connections from your application‚Äôs IP address.
